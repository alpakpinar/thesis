I am very grateful to my academic advisor, Prof. Zeynep Demiragli, for all her guidance and support since the start of my PhD. 
Under her influence, I had the chance to learn a lot and work with a lot of great people in very interesting projects. 
I'd also like to thank my committee, Prof. James Rohlf, Prof. David Sperka, Prof. Martin
Schmaltz and Prof. Shyamsunder Erramilli. Also thanks to Prof. Emanuel Katz for attending my preliminary oral exam and departmental seminar. 

I'd like to thank all the faculty, researchers and engineers I worked with in the CMS group at Boston University, 
from whom I learned a lot. Special thanks to Daniel Gastler, for teaching me a lot about C++ programming and good software 
development practices. Also special thanks to Andreas Albert, for
teaching me a lot about physics, communication and other technical skills, and inspiring me in my journey throughout my PhD. I'd also like to thank
Prof. James Rohlf for his very detailed comments on this thesis. In addition, I'd like to thank my student colleagues and friends at the high energy
physics group here at Boston University.

I'd like to thank my family for their support all the way from Turkey, even under the most stressful of situations. I'd also like to thank 
my girlfriend Natalia Valles, for her emotional support throughout my program, and making Boston a beautiful and more fun city to live
for me.
