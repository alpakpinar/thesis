To get the best-fit value of the signal strength $\mu=\sigmabr$, a maximum-likelihood fit is performed
across all different signal and control regions in the analysis, using the likelihood function given 
in Eq.~\ref{eq:fit_likelihood_func}. In this fit, data from 2017 and 2018 are combined. Theoretical uncertainties
are treated as correlated between different years, while some experimental uncertainties, such as the jet energy
scale uncertainties, are partially correlated between different years, depending on the uncertainty source.
The partial correlation scheme is in accordance with the recommendations from the relevant POGs.
The theoretical and experimental uncertainties are discussed in depth in Sec.~\ref{subsec:sys_uncertainties}.

Figs.~\ref{fig:pre_postfit_sr_and_gamma}, \ref{fig:pre_postfit_dilepton_regions}, \ref{fig:pre_postfit_single_lepton_regions}
show the results of the 2017+2018 combined fit in all control regions and the signal region of the analysis.
Data observed in each region is compared to the background predictions from simulation and data-driven estimates (pre-fit) and
background predictions after the fit (post-fit). Overall, it can be observed that post-fit background
estimates are in very good agreement with the observed data, and no significant pulls 
($data - prediction / uncertainty > 2\sigma$) are observed when fitting the data. 

For the signal region plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:pre_postfit_sr_and_gamma} (top row), two data-driven multijet background estimates
have been shown, which represent the events where $\ptmiss$ arises from mismeasured jets. The first multijet estimate, labeled as ``HF Estimate", 
represents the noise estimation related to events with forward jets in Forward HCAL (HF) detector, where the mismeasured jet is balanced
with $\ptmiss$, therefore $\Delta\phi$($\ptvecjet$,$\ptvecmiss$) is large. The derivation of this estimate is explained in Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:hf_noise_est}.

The second data-driven estimate is labeled as ``QCD", which is an independent estimate of events where the mismeasured jet is aligned with $\ptmiss$,
therefore $\Delta\phi$($\ptvecjet$,$\ptvecmiss$) is small. This background is estimated from another control region, where the $\Delta\phi$($\ptvecjet$,$\ptvecmiss$)
$> 0.5$ selection (listed in Table.~\ref{tab:selection_mtr}) is inverted, as explained in ~\cite{VBFHinvAnalysisPaper}.

The observed event yields for each $\mjj$ bin, and the corresponding expected event yields from each background process are summarized in Tables~\ref{tab:yields_MTR_2017} and
\ref{tab:yields_MTR_2018}.
